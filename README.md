This repository presents the entire code for the TMR Flashcard & Ambience App developed from the TMR Flashcard App utilized in the Master Thesis "Smartphone Application for Auditory Targeted Memory Reactivation Supported Flashcard Learning - Testing Verbal vs Nonverbal Cues for Vocabulary Learning". 

The attached release presents the Android .apk for app installation.

# Usage

The app allows the creation of custom flashcard decks. Each flashcard is matched to a unique cue sound, which can be replayed at night. Replay start after a 15 minute elongatable buffer, so that users can fall asleep in peace. 

Selecting "Half Replay Mode" selects only half of all flashcards in the deck for replay, to test whether the nightly replay influences learning. 

Sound checks play sounds not associated with the flashcards to find a suitable replay volume level for the night. Sounds play with reduced volume for sound checks and replay. 

User can also opt for continuous replay TMR with three ambiences.
